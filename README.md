    TERMINOLOGIES USED IN DATA
Problem Statement:
To monitor and assess bank‚Äôs lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insight into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us to make data driven decisions, track our loan portfolio and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

Fields Used in Data
Loan ID:
Purpose: Loan ID is a unique identifier assigned to each loan application or loan account. It serves as a primary key for tracking and managing individual loans.
Use for Banks: Banks use Loan IDs to efficiently manage and track loans throughout their lifecycle. It aids in organizing loan records, monitoring repayments, and addressing customer inquiries.

Address State:
Purpose: Address State indicates the borrower's location. It helps in assessing regional risk factors, compliance with state regulations, and estimating default probabilities.
Use for Banks: Banks use this information to identify regional trends in loan demand, adjust marketing strategies, and manage risk portfolios based on geographic regions.

Employee Length:
Purpose: Employee Length provides insights into the borrower's employment stability. Longer employment durations may indicate greater job security.
Use for Banks: Banks consider employment length when assessing a borrower's ability to repay. Stable employment often translates to a lower default risk.

Employee Title:
Purpose: Employee Title specifies the borrower's occupation or job title. It helps lenders understand the source of the borrower's income.
Use for Banks: Banks use this field to verify income sources, assess the borrower's financial capacity, and tailor loan offers to different professions.

Grade:

Use for Banks: Banks use the grade to price loans and manage risk. Higher-grade loans typically receive lower interest rates and are more attractive to investors.

Sub Grade:
Purpose: Sub Grade refines the risk assessment within a grade, providing additional risk differentiation.
Use for Banks: Sub Grades offer a finer level of risk assessment, helping banks tailor interest rates and lending terms to match borrower risk profiles.

Home Ownership:
Purpose: Home Ownership indicates the borrower's housing status. It offers insights into financial stability.

Last Credit Pull Date:

Last Payment Date:
Purpose: Last Payment Date marks the most recent loan payment received. It tracks the borrower's payment history.

Loan Status:
Purpose: Loan Status indicates the current state of the loan (e.g., fully paid, current, default). It tracks loan performance.
Use for Banks: Banks use Loan Status to monitor loan health, categorize loans for risk analysis, and determine provisioning requirements.

Next Payment Date:
Purpose: Next Payment Date estimates the date of the next loan payment. It assists in cash flow forecasting.
Use for Banks: Banks use this date for liquidity planning and to project revenue from loan portfolios.

Purpose:
